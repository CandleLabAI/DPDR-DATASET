# DPDR Dataset
# A Dataset of Retinal Fundus images of Healthy and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Patients

## Request Description:
This dataset is concerned with the final stage .i.e. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. This stage is characterised by the growth of new blood vessels on the surface of the retina which may leak and cause retinal edema (a condition in which there is a buildup of fluid in the centre of the retina that causes a distorted vision). This can lead to loss of the vision.

## Dataset description: 

The dataset is divided into two subsets. First set consists of 250 retinal fundus images of healthy individuals and second set consists of 250 fundus images of patients with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR).
